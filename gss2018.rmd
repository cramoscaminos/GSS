#  Question 1

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

The data in the dataframe GSSdata is from the 2018 General Social Survey. The first blocks of R-code has selected down a subset of the data to just 16 variables. It has further removed unwanted factor levels in much of the data. Examine the code in the GrabData.R file to see what it is doing. Some of the variables are categorical and others are numerical. Be sure to do a variable analysis before tackling each question.  
First question - Is opinion on the death penalty (CAPPUN) independent of gun ownership (OWNGUN)?


## Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->

##Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

### Descriptive Results

#### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

#### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->

### Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

#  Question 2

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

Is there a difference in years of education (EDUC) between the those who did or did not vote in 2012 (VOTE12)?  

$H_0$ There is no difference related to years of education and voting  

$H_A$ There is a difference in years of education related to voting. 

## Methods  

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->   

The variables are num~cat EDUC is a numerical variable; VOTE12 is a categorical variable. Years of EDUC and if the voted Yes or No?    
We will use a boxplot, and we will use a t-test

### Descriptive Results

#### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->  


```{r} 
boxplot(EDUC~VOTE12, data=GSSdata)
```

It appears based on the box plot individuals who completed high school were less likely to have voted in 2012.It looks like 50% of individuals with high school education did not vote. Individuals with higher education voted more often than not. The majority median of people who voted also had higher education.   

#### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->  


```{r}
favstats(EDUC~VOTE12,data=GSSdata)
```
  
Based on the chart above it shows that the median years of education of those who voted in 2012 had at least 16 years of education; this compares to those who did not vote in 2012 whom had a median of 13 years of education.  It is safe to say that individuals with higher education tend to vote more often.   

### Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->  

```{r}
t.test(EDUC~VOTE12,  data=GSSdata )
```
  
The T-test shows that the P-value is 0.0000001248 a number significantly less than 0.05. I reject the null hypothesis, and I accept the alternative hypothesis. Voting in 2012 is dependent on the years of education, and is a factor that determined whether or not individuals voted.  


#  Question 3

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

Determine if a persons performance on the wordsum test (WORDSUM) is independent of their level of schooling (DEGREE).

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
