#  Question 1

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

The data in the dataframe GSSdata is from the 2018 General Social Survey. The first blocks of R-code has selected down a subset of the data to just 16 variables. It has further removed unwanted factor levels in much of the data. Examine the code in the GrabData.R file to see what it is doing. Some of the variables are categorical and others are numerical. Be sure to do a variable analysis before tackling each question.  
First question - Is opinion on the death penalty (CAPPUN) independent of gun ownership (OWNGUN)?  

$H_0$ The opinion on the death penalty is not dependent of gun ownership    
$H_A$ The opinion of death penalty is dependent of gun ownership 

## Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method.!-->  

Both variables are categorical; each with two levels OWNGUN Yes or No? CAPPUN Yes or No.  
We will use the cat~cat analysis, chi-squared test of independence. We will use the Fisher exact test for odds ratio. 

##Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!--> 

### Descriptive Results  


#### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->  

```{r}
barchartGC(~OWNGUN + CAPPUN,data=GSSdata)
barchartGC(~OWNGUN + CAPPUN,data=GSSdata, type="percent")

```
 
Those individuals that own guns are more likely to favor the death penalty. People who do not own guns are are about even in their in opinion of capital Punishment. 


#### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->  

```{r}
table1 <- xtabs(~OWNGUN + CAPPUN, data=GSSdata)
rowPerc(table1)
colPerc(table1)
```
  
People who own guns are 75.68 in favor of capital punishment; while 24.32 of gun owners oppose capital punishment.That is a significat difference. In comparison, people who do not own guns are 57.69 in favor versus to 42.31 of non gun owners who oppose capital punishment. There is not much of a difference. 

### Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->  
 
```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
chisqtestGC(table1)
fisher.test(table1)
```

The p-value is 0.02022 less than 0.05. I reject the  $H_0$ null hypothesis and accept the alternative. Individuals opinion on the death penalty is dependent on gun ownership. The odds ratio is 2.271. People who own guns are 2.2x more likely to favor capital punishment.   

#  Question 2

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

Is there a difference in years of education (EDUC) between the those who did or did not vote in 2012 (VOTE12)?

Determine if a persons performance on the wordsum test (WORDSUM) is independent of their level of schooling (DEGREE).

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->
